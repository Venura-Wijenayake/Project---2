        <h2>Welcome to the Kronous Expanse!</h2>
        <p>For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor
          has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of
          Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will ofs
          the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might
          of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass
          writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of
          Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium
          for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day,
          so that he may never truly die.
          Yet in his deathless state, the Emperor continues
          his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the
          Daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only
          route between distant stars, their way lit by the
          Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the
          Emperor’s will. Vast armies give battle in his name
          on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers
          are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bioengineered
          super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are
          legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary
          defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the
          Tech-Priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus, to name
          but a few. But for all their multitudes, they are
          barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from
          aliens, heretics, mutants—and worse.
          To be a man in such times is to be one amongst
          untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and
          most bloody regime imaginable. Yet you are not just
          any individual—you are an explorer aboard a Rogue
          Trader ship with authority and freedom far beyond
          the comprehension of the masses. Empowered by an
          ancient warrant of trade and a warp-capable ship,
          you venture into the uncharted voids, discovering new
          worlds, lost civilisations, and bizarre alien technology.
          Fortune and glory are yours for the taking. Rogue
          Traders stand on the threshold of unlimited
          opportunity and innumerable dangers.</p>
