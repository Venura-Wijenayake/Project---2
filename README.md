# Battleship

//Description

The Battleship Game is a classic strategy game where players aim to sink each other's fleet of ships on a grid-based battlefield. It is a turn-based game that requires skill, logic, and a bit of luck to outsmart your opponent and emerge victorious.

//Background

The origins of the game can be traced back to the pencil-and-paper game "Salvo," which was played by soldiers during World War I.

Next steps:
-Improve the AI targeting logic. I would make the AI attempt to close in on a hit and completely destroy a target, by checking adjectent tiles first.

-Fix a minor bug which occurs, when aggresively clicking the playerboard. This creates duplicates of the last deployed ship, and can even persist after game is started.
