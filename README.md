# Rogue Trader - Campaign Manager

//Description

Rogue Trader is a tabletop role-playing game set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40,000 (40K), which is a dystopian sci-fi setting created by Games Workshop. In this game, players take on the roles of intrepid Rogue Traders, individuals granted great authority by the Imperium of Mankind to explore and exploit uncharted regions of space.

As a Rogue Trader, players command a starship and a crew, embarking on perilous adventures across the galaxy. They can explore unknown worlds, encounter strange alien species, trade with various factions, engage in space battles, and uncover ancient secrets and treasures. The game emphasizes exploration, diplomacy, and combat, allowing players to forge alliances, negotiate deals, and wage war in the name of profit and glory.

//Background

Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is the first edition of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop wargame, originally released in 1987 by Games Workshop. It laid the foundation for the vast and expansive Warhammer 40,000 universe that has since become a popular and enduring franchise.

Setting and Concept:
Rogue Trader is set in the far future of the 41st millennium, in a dystopian and gothic sci-fi universe. The game is heavily influenced by classic science fiction, gothic horror, and elements of fantasy. In this universe, humanity has spread across the galaxy, but its dominion is under constant threat from alien races, daemonic entities, and internal strife.

The game's name, "Rogue Trader," refers to the player characters who take on the role of intrepid explorers, adventurers, and traders. These characters have been granted a Warrant of Trade by the Imperium of Man, giving them authority and independence to explore uncharted regions of space, establish colonies, and engage in trade beyond the established borders of the Imperium.

Next steps:
-I would like to implement the Adventure log and Event Pages.

-Eventually all major stats like special abilities, can be put into its own table, and turned into a dropdown menu. Doing so improves error validation, and improves our database lexicon.
